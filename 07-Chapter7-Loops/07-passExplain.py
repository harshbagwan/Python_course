# Python program demonstrating 'pass' statement

# Definition: 'pass' is a null statement that does nothing.
# It is used as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors in empty blocks.

def my_function():
    # Function yet to be implemented
    pass  # Placeholder, avoids indentation error

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # Does nothing, just a placeholder
    print(i)  # Continues execution normally

# Key Takeaways:
# - 'pass' is used when a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed.
# - It does not affect program flow.
# - Commonly used in function/class definitions, loops, and conditional statements.
